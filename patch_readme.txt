Thank you for viewing the English translation patch for Spice and Wolf: Boku to Holo no Ichinen, created by the Anime Game Translations Team!

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM.

===

Instructions

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/ 
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.nds' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'BokutoHoloPatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!
*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you’d like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick “Backup original file”. This will create a new ‘--PATCHED.nds’ file instead.

Play this file on an emulator such as DeSmuME, or use a flashcart to play it on any member of the NDS family.

We hope you enjoy!

Extra Content

A file containing translated cheat codes for DeSmuME has been included in the download. (BokutoHoloCheats.dct) To use it, rename the file to match the English-patched ROM and drop it into your DeSmuME's cheats folder.

Changes to the game
A list of bug fixes/tweaks that were made to the original ROM.

-Added subtitles to the opening movie & special message
-Adjusted line spacing for white speech bubble messages (rumors, tips, etc.), to allow for six lines to be used instead of 5.
-Fixed a mistake during the “Confectionary Contest” consultation in which the Grocer's nametag is shown for two of Holo's lines.
